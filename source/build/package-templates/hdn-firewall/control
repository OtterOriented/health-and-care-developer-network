Description: HDN firewall
 This script provides firewall scripts.
 It runs a daemon on ifup and ifdown.
 The intention is provide a way to securely block access
 on a server-by-server basis
 .
 The dependency on upstart wraps dependencies on initscripts,
 debianutils (run-parts), lsb-base and ifupdown.
 .
 hdn-nss is a pre-dependency to ensure the current hostname
 is always resolvable, as is the current gateway
 (using /etc/nsswitch.conf).
